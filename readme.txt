An easy to use widget that displays your SWTOR guild's current recruiting needs.

== Description ==

It provides a single admin page to manage the recruitment status for both Empire and Republic factions.  
At the widget page, you can run multiple instances of the widget, including both Empire and Republic at the same time if you are a dual faction guild.
Can be set to display in English, French, or German.
